## Overall Idea:
Imagine a community-powered event platform where NFT purchases equate to investing in exciting event ventures. Users can either create events themselves or propose them to the community. Event organizers may need to stake to ensure trust, with validation methods tailored to each scenario. Additionally, crowdfunding events offer NFT holders revenue-sharing opportunities, and a user-friendly app ensures transparent profit-sharing. This innovative platform brings together community-driven event creation, crowdfunding, and NFT investments seamlessly and securely.

### A. First Aspect - Event Creation and Crowdfunding Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: User-Initiated Events
- **Any community member can create events** or delegate event organization through mutual agreement.
- **Event organizers must stake funds** for larger events, ensuring community trust and preventing fraudulent schemes.
- **No central review**; community members collectively govern all aspects of the event.

#### Scenario 2: Proposal-Based Crowdfunding
- **Organizers propose events**, followed by community voting to gauge interest.
- **High-demand events with substantial funding** require organizers to stake funds.
- **Event validation methods** include user consensus, audience polls, or a hybrid approach.

#### Scenario 3: Ideation and Staking
- **The app users can suggest event ideas** on an idea board.
- **Ideas gaining a threshold level of support** trigger a vote.
- **Approved organizers must stake** to proceed, ensuring commitment.
- **Funding validation methods** align with community preferences.

### B. Second Aspect - Crowdfunding for Revenue Sharing
- **Treat NFT purchases for events** as similar to investing in an ICO/IPO.
- **Users can crowdfund events**, with NFT holders receiving a share of event revenue.
- **Utilize a flexible app** for ticket redemption to transparently calculate profits.
- **Staking requirements may apply** for event organizers, depending on the event's nature.
- **Organizers can pitch their ideas** before initiating crowdfunding.

Additionally, TokenFest will use NFC tags to distribute POAPs for DreamStarter Collab and Holder, ensuring that only POAP users can give reviews and ratings. This setup also provides insights into event income sources, including advertisements. A two-week dispute period is included in the validation process, allowing stakeholders to raise and substantiate discrepancies.
